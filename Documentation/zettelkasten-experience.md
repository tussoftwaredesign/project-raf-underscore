# Abstact

Niklas Luhmann, a German sociologist, was confronted with a dilemma in the 1950s. As a researcher, he was continually absorbing material in order to expand his knowledge in his specialty. As a result, he was unable to keep this information in a memorable manner. This led to him creating the Zettelkasten method that we see today.

The Zettelkasten approach assists you in collecting and categorizing your thoughts, ideas, and facts. Following the methods and technique, you can build on your existing knowledge and develop a knowledge archive of your files and information that is a close enough reproduction of your brain's system of how it operates.

We may see three software trends attempting to meet or reproduce this method

1. Spatial canvases (e.g., Muse, Figma),
2. Knowledge graphs (e.g., Roam, Obsidian), and

Legacy tools, on the other hand, are limited by their flat, bounded interfaces. With the push in mixed reality based productivity, I see an avenue for applications like Notion to revitilise there system within a virtual reality landscape.

# Design

The challenge will be to make this intuitive within a virtual reality landscape. The block method is one that I think will work the best rather than a spatial enviroment as seen with Obsidians workflow.

A block based system will also make editing and reorganizing files much more simpler than finding them withing a web of links.

### Limitations

---

Oculus keyboard tracking only supports two keyboards as of now, being the logitech and the apple magic keyboard. This will lead to problems as the ease of typing with a keyboard will be lost and the user will have to type withing the actual app, which could be slow and non useful.

Due to this reason, this feature could be left out till the end.

# User

The intended user is a person who valuse information and storing the information in meaningful ways. For example:

- An entrepreneur creating a product specification document
- A design researcher summarizing user interviews
- An architect creating a presentation for a new project
- A graduate student sketching up a chapter of her thesis

They collect information, make sense of it, and draft documents using a combination of analog and digital tools. Most importantly, they are looking for a way to visualize their information and store it in a more streamline manner.

# Workflow

The expected user workflow should go as follows, this example will take into consideration that the user is using a note taking app like Notion. The said user is trying to draft a project proposal

1. Compiling

In this stage, the user will start compiling their infomration gathered within a Notion page. This can be anything from simple notes about an article they read, databases with valuable information or any images or media that they find useful.

1. Integrating

The user will then launch the app withing their headset and connect their notion account. This will bring them to the page they last made and it will generate zettels based on their findings.

1. Curation

The user will then be able to edit the pages within the mixed reality experience with their own keyboard, controller or hands, or all three at once. The user will also be able to create links and also see these links to build a knowledge graph of all their information.

1. Exporting

The user will have the ability to export in the following ways. One way is just exporting all the information to a markdown file to be pasted into a github readme or something similar. Another way will be to save the infromation as a sort of power point presentation, wherby the user will be able to go through each zetell one by one. They could also just save the information, so that they can use it as their state for another time.
